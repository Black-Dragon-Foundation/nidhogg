;;; Commentary:

;; Glitnir's own Lisp, preloaded when Nidhogg is built with Glitnir
;; (loadup.el's one `(featurep 'glitnir)' line).  Glitnir changes no
;; other Lisp file: its options, faces and resolver live here.

;;; Code:

(defface glitnir-debug-damage
  '((t :background "red"))
  "Face whose background flashes the rectangles Glitnir committed.
Used when `glitnir-debug' is `damage'."
  :version "31.1"
  :group 'basic-faces)

(provide 'glitnir-lisp)

;;; glitnir.el ends here
